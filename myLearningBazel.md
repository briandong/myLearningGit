# myLearningBazel

## Introduction

Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make.

Bazel builds software from source code organized in a directory called a workspace. Source files in the workspace are organized in a nested hierarchy of packages, where each package is a directory that contains a set of related source files and one BUILD file. The BUILD file specifies what software outputs can be built from the source.

### Workspace

A workspace is a directory on your filesystem that contains the source files for the software you want to build, as well as symbolic links to directories that contain the build outputs. 

Each workspace directory has a text file named WORKSPACE which may be empty, or may contain references to external dependencies required to build the outputs.

### Package

A package is defined as a directory containing a file named BUILD, residing beneath the top-level directory in the workspace. 

### Target

The elements of a package are called targets. Most targets are one of two principal kinds, files and rules.

### Labels

All targets belong to exactly one package. The name of a target is called its label, and a typical label in canonical form looks like this:

```python
//path/to/target:target_name
```

## Key Files

### WORKSPACE

WORKSPACE rules (mainly for external dependencies) include:

1. bind
1. git_repository
1. http_archive
1. http_file
1. http_jar
1. local_repository
1. maven_jar
1. maven_server
1. new_git_repository
1. new_http_archive
1. new_local_repository
1. xcode_config
1. xcode_version

Refer to:

* https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/workspace.html

### BUILD

Every rule has a name, specified by the name attribute, of type string.

BUILD rules include:

1. filegroup
2. genquery
3. test_suite
4. alias
5. config_setting
6. genrule

Refer to:

* https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html

## Phases

A build consists of three phases.

* Loading phase. First, we load and evaluate all extensions and all BUILD files that are needed for the build. The execution of the BUILD files simply instantiates rules (each time a rule is called, it gets added to a graph). This is where macros are evaluated.
* Analysis phase. The code of the rules is executed (their implementation function), and actions are instantiated. An action describes how to generate a set of outputs from a set of inputs, e.g. "run gcc on hello.c and get hello.o". It is important to note that we have to list explicitly which files will be generated before executing the actual commands. In other words, the analysis phase takes the graph generated by the loading phase and generates an action graph.
* Execution phase. Actions are executed, when at least one of their outputs is required. If a file is missing or if a command fails to generate one output, the build fails. Tests are also run during this phase.

## Extension 

Bazel extensions are files ending in .bzl. Use the load statement to import a symbol from an extension.
```python
load("//build_tools/rules:maprule.bzl", "maprule")
```
This code will load the file build_tools/rules/maprule.bzl and add the maprule symbol to the environment. 

## Skylark Language

### Overview
Skylark, the language used in Bazel. 

* https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html

### macro
A macro is a function called from the BUILD file that can instantiate rules. Macros don't give additional power, they are just used for encapsulation and code reuse. 

Native rules (i.e. rules that don't need a load() statement) can be instantiated from the native module:

```python
def my_macro(name, visibility=None):
  native.cc_library(
    name = name,
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    visibility = visibility,
  )
```
Refer to: 

- https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/macros.html

### rule

A rule defines a series of actions that Bazel should perform on inputs to get a set of outputs.

In a .bzl file, use the rule function to create a new rule and store it in a global variable:
```python
def _empty_impl(ctx):
    # This function is called when the rule is analyzed.
    print("This rule does nothing")

empty = rule(implementation = _empty_impl)
```
The rule can then be loaded in BUILD files:
```python
load("//empty:empty.bzl", "empty")

# Run 'bazel build :nothing'. The target will be successfully analyzed
empty(name = "nothing")
```

#### attribute 

An attribute is a rule argument, such as srcs or deps. You must list the attributes and their types when you define a rule. Create attributes using the attr module.
```python
def _impl(ctx):
    # Print debug information about the target.
    print("Target {} has {} deps".format(ctx.label, len(ctx.attr.deps)))

    # For each target in deps, print its label and files.
    for i, d in enumerate(ctx.attr.deps):
        print(" {}. label = {}".format(i + 1, d.label))

        # A label can represent any number of files (possibly 0).
        print("    files = " + str([f.path for f in d.files.to_list()]))

    # For debugging, consider using `dir` to explore the existing fields.
    print(dir(ctx))  # prints all the fields and methods of ctx
    print(dir(ctx.attr))  # prints all the attributes of the rule

printer = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = {
        # Do not declare "name": It is added automatically.
        "number": attr.int(default = 1),
        "deps": attr.label_list(allow_files = True),
    },
)
```

#### implementation function
Every rule requires an implementation function. Rule implementation functions are usually private (i.e., named with a leading underscore) because they tend not to be reused.

Implementation functions take exactly one parameter: a rule context, conventionally named ctx. It can be used to:

* access attribute values and obtain handles on declared input and output files;
* create actions; and
* pass information to other targets that depend on this one, via providers.

#### target

Each call to a build rule has the side effect of defining a new target (also called instantiating the rule). 

#### action

An action describes how to generate a set of outputs from a set of inputs.

All functions that create actions are defined in ctx.actions:
* ctx.actions.run, to run an executable.
* ctx.actions.run_shell, to run a shell command.
* ctx.actions.write, to write a string to a file.
* ctx.actions.expand_template, to generate a file from a template.

For example, in a .bzl file, use the rule function to create a new rule:

```python
"""Execute a binary.
The example below executes the binary target "//actions_run:merge" with
some arguments. The binary will be automatically built by Bazel.
The rule must declare its dependencies. To do that, we pass the target to
the attribute "_merge_tool". Since it starts with an underscore, it is private
and users cannot redefine it.
"""

def _impl(ctx):
    # The list of arguments we pass to the script.
    args = [ctx.outputs.out.path] + [f.path for f in ctx.files.chunks]

    # Action to call the script.
    ctx.actions.run(
        inputs = ctx.files.chunks,
        outputs = [ctx.outputs.out],
        arguments = args,
        progress_message = "Merging into %s" % ctx.outputs.out.short_path,
        executable = ctx.executable._merge_tool,
    )

concat = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = {
        "chunks": attr.label_list(allow_files = True),
        "out": attr.output(mandatory = True),
        "_merge_tool": attr.label(
            executable = True,
            cfg = "host",
            allow_files = True,
            default = Label("//actions_run:merge"),
        ),
    },
)
```

The rule can then be loaded in BUILD files:

```python
load(":execute.bzl", "concat")

concat(
    name = "sh",
    out = "page.html",
    chunks = [
        "header.html",
        "body.html",
        "footer.html",
    ],
)

# This target is used by the shell rule.
sh_binary(
    name = "merge",
    srcs = ["merge.sh"],
)
```

#### provider

Providers are pieces of information that a rule exposes to other rules that depend on it.

Providers are the only mechanism to exchange data between rules, and can be thought of as part of a rule's public interface (loosely analogous to a function's return value).

A rule can only see the providers of its direct dependencies.

For example, in a .bzl file, create a rule with a mandatory provider:

```python
"""Rule with a mandatory provider.
In this example, rules have a number attribute. Each rule adds its number
with the numbers of its transitive dependencies, and write the result in a
file. This shows how to transfer information from a dependency to its
dependents.
"""

NumberInfo = provider("number")

def _impl(ctx):
    result = ctx.attr.number
    for dep in ctx.attr.deps:
        result += dep[NumberInfo].number
    ctx.file_action(output = ctx.outputs.out, content = str(result))

    # Return the provider with result, visible to other rules.
    return [NumberInfo(number = result)]

sum = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = {
        "number": attr.int(default = 1),
        # All deps must provide all listed providers.
        "deps": attr.label_list(providers = [NumberInfo]),
    },
    outputs = {"out": "%{name}.sum"},
)
```

The rule can then be loaded in BUILD files:

```python
load(":sum.bzl", "sum")

sum(
    name = "n",
    deps = [
        ":n2",
        ":n5",
    ],
)

sum(
    name = "n2",
    number = 2,
)

sum(
    name = "n5",
    number = 5,
)
```

#### runfiles  

Runfiles are a set of files used by the (often executable) output of a rule during runtime (as opposed to build time, i.e. when the binary itself is generated). During the execution phase, Bazel creates a directory tree containing symlinks pointing to the runfiles. This stages the environment for the binary so it can access the runfiles during runtime.

Runfiles can be added manually during rule creation and/or collected transitively from the rule's dependencies:
```python
def _rule_implementation(ctx):
  ...
  transitive_runfiles = depset(transitive=
    [dep.transitive_runtime_files for dep in ctx.attr.special_dependencies])

  runfiles = ctx.runfiles(
      # Add some files manually.
      files = [ctx.file.some_data_file],
      # Add transitive files from dependencies manually.
      transitive_files = transitive_runfiles,
      # Collect runfiles from the common locations: transitively from srcs,
      # deps and data attributes.
      collect_default = True,
  )
  # Add a field named "runfiles" to the DefaultInfo provider in order to actually
  # create the symlink tree.
  return [DefaultInfo(runfiles=runfiles)]
```

### depset

Depsets are a specialized data structure for efficiently collecting data across a target’s transitive dependencies. 

The main feature of depsets is that they support a time- and space-efficient merge operation, whose cost is independent of the size of the existing contents. Depsets also have well-defined ordering semantics.

For example, in a .bzl file:

```python
# A provider with one field, transitive_sources.
FooFiles = provider(fields = ["transitive_sources"])

def get_transitive_srcs(srcs, deps):
  """Obtain the source files for a target and its transitive dependencies.

  Args:
    srcs: a list of source files
    deps: a list of targets that are direct dependencies
  Returns:
    a collection of the transitive sources
  """
  return depset(
        srcs,
        transitive = [dep[FooFiles].transitive_sources for dep in deps])

def _foo_library_impl(ctx):
  trans_srcs = get_transitive_srcs(ctx.files.srcs, ctx.attr.deps)
  return [FooFiles(transitive_sources=trans_srcs)]

foo_library = rule(
    implementation = _foo_library_impl,
    attrs = {
        "srcs": attr.label_list(allow_files=True),
        "deps": attr.label_list(),
    },
)

def _foo_binary_impl(ctx):
  foocc = ctx.executable._foocc
  out = ctx.outputs.out
  trans_srcs = get_transitive_srcs(ctx.files.srcs, ctx.attr.deps)
  srcs_list = trans_srcs.to_list()
  ctx.actions.run(executable = foocc,
                  arguments = [out.path] + [src.path for src in srcs_list],
                  inputs = srcs_list + [foocc],
                  outputs = [out])

foo_binary = rule(
    implementation = _foo_binary_impl,
    attrs = {
        "srcs": attr.label_list(allow_files=True),
        "deps": attr.label_list(),
        "_foocc": attr.label(default=Label("//depsets:foocc"),
                             allow_files=True, executable=True, cfg="host")
    },
    outputs = {"out": "%{name}.out"},
)
```

### aspect

Aspects allow augmenting build dependency graphs with additional information and actions. 

Aspects are similar to rules in that they have an implementation function that generates actions and returns providers. However, their power comes from the way the dependency graph is built for them. An aspect has an implementation and a list of all attributes it propagates along. 

This example demonstrates how to recursively print the source files for a rule and all of its dependencies that have a deps attribute. It shows an aspect implementation, an aspect definition, and how to invoke the aspect from the Bazel command line.
```python
def _print_aspect_impl(target, ctx):
    # Make sure the rule has a srcs attribute.
    if hasattr(ctx.rule.attr, 'srcs'):
        # Iterate through the files that make up the sources and
        # print their paths.
        for src in ctx.rule.attr.srcs:
            for f in src.files:
                print(f.path)
    return []

print_aspect = aspect(
    implementation = _print_aspect_impl,
    # attr_aspects is a list of rule attributes along which the aspect propagates
    attr_aspects = ['deps'],
)
```
The simplest way to apply an aspect is from the command line using the --aspects argument. Assuming the rule above were defined in a file named print.bzl this:
```python
bazel build //MyExample:example --aspects print.bzl%print_aspect
```
would apply the print_aspect to the target example and all of the target rules that are accessible recursively via the deps attribute.
